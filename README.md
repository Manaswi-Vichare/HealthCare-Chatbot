# HealthCare-Chatbot

**Final-year B.Tech project in Computer Science and Engineering (Intelligent Systems) at MIT School of Engineering, MIT ADT University.**

**Abstract:**

With changing times due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it is advisable to leave our houses only during emergencies. Despite the fact that hospitals maintain adequate precautions, people still remain fearful of visiting them due to the risk of getting infected. In the safe confines of one's own 
 home, this work can be used to analyze and understand diseases and symptoms. It contains a Medical Test webpage that makes predictions about various illnesses using the concept of machine learning. If the user wants to know the cause for the particular symptom, they can use the chat-bot
facility. The chat-bot will ask to state the symptoms which the user is experiencing. The user can state their symptoms one by one and receive the predicted output. It will also provide the probability of the illness occurring based on the symptoms. A set of possible future symptoms are also displayed concerning the probable disease. When an emergency occurs, it helps pinpoint what is wrong and recommends expert doctors based on their Practo profile to schedule an appointment.

**Algorithms/Techniques used:**

1. Neural Network
2. NLP (NLTK, Porterstemmer, Tokenization, Stemming, Bag of Words)
3. Logistic Regression
4. Sequential Model
5. Flask
